        <h2>What is Big Data ?</h2>
        <p>
          The term ‚Äúbig data‚Äù refers to data that is so large, fast or complex
          that it‚Äôs difficult or impossible to process using traditional
          methods. The act of accessing and storing large amounts of information
          for analytics has been around a long time. But the concept of big data
          gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney
          articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three V‚Äôs

        <h2>What are the three V‚Äôs?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Volume: Organizations collect data from a variety of sources,
            including business transactions, smart (IoT) devices, industrial
            equipment, videos, social media and more. In the past, storing it
            would have been a problem ‚Äì but cheaper storage on platforms like
            data lakes and Hadoop have eased the burden.
          </li>
          <li>
            Velocity: With the growth in the Internet of Things, data streams in
            to businesses at an unprecedented speed and must be handled in a
            timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart meters are driving the
            need to deal with these torrents of data in near-real time.

          <li>
            Variety:¬†Data comes in all types of formats ‚Äì from structured,
            numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text
            documents, emails, videos, audios, stock ticker data and financial
            transactions.

        <h2>Why is Big Data important ?</h2>
        <p>
          The importance of big data doesn‚Äôt revolve around how much data you
          have, but what you do with it. You can take data from any source and
          analyze it to find answers that enable cost reductions, time
          reductions, new product development and optimized offerings, and smart
          decision making. When you combine big data with high-powered
          analytics, you can accomplish business-related tasks such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Determining root causes of failures, issues and defects in near-real
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generating coupons at the point of sale based on the customer‚Äôs
            buying habits.
          </li>
          <li>Recalculating entire risk portfolios in minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Detecting fraudulent behavioUr before it affects your organization.
